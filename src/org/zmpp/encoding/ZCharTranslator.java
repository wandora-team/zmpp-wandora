/**
 * The Z char translator is central for Z char encoding and decoding. We provide
 * an abstract interface, so the decoding and encoding algorithms can be based
 * on this.
 *
 * It is basically an alphabet table combined with a current alphabet and
 * depending on this state, decides, whether to shift or translate. We want to
 * have alphabet tables as stateless information providers, so we can keep them
 * fairly simple.
 *
 * Shift characters will move the object into another alphabet for the duration
 * of one character. If the current alphabet is A2, willEscapeA2() indicates
 * that the given character escapes to 10bit translation, the client is
 * responsible to join those characters and the translator will not do anything
 * about it, since it can only handle bytes.
 *
 * Shift lock characters are a little special: The object will remember the
 * shift locked state until a reset() is called, if a regular shift occurs, the
 * alphabet will be changed for one translation and will return to the last
 * locked state. Since the translation process employs abbreviations and
 * ZSCII-Escape-Sequences which are external to this class, the method
 * resetToLastAlphabet() is provided to reset the state from the client after an
 * external translation has been performed.
